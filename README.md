# NoShowAppts
This project was completed as part Udacity's Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree Program (egFWD initiative).

This iPython notebook inspects a dataset of 100k Show/No-Show medical appointments in Brazil. Original dataset can be found on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments
The code cleans the dataset, performs an exploratory analysis, and attempts to determine which factors are the most important in predicting whether a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment.
The iPython notebook is also available in HTML.
